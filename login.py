# random script to login to iiitd network
# A very hacky script, expect refinments over time
# 
# The most irritating way, but ofcourse, the most showoff way is to use it like an interacitive script, but if you are lazy,
# then its better you comment line the raw_input('Username:') and the raw_input('Password:') file and just punch in your 
# password and username in the commented fields

# I hope I rewrite this in a much saner way.. but till then this is what it is...
# btw i hope fidu has gotten the script
